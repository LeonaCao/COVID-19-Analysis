# COVID-19-Analysis

As COVID-19 broke out across the U.S. from the mid of March 2020, we were tasked with data visualizations during the Data Science course to analyze COVID-19 confirmed cases data around the world and particularly around the U.S.

This is the third assignment in my Data Science course.

Firstly, I made a line plot to compare trends of COVID-19 confirmed cases increase in top 10 countries. 

Besides, I made a bubble plot based on the U.S. geospatial data to visualize the COVID-19 confirmed cases nationwide. 

Finally, the COVID-19 confirmed cases data was also used in plotting a heat map to illustrate the continuing upward trend of the grim situation across the world through a timeline. Note that the heat map I made is a dynamic table where individual cells can be magnified with the exact numbers while the mouse is passing. But since the file uploaded is a Jubyter notebook, the output is not able to function properly here.
